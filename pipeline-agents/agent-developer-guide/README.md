# Agent Developer Guide

As your journey continues with LangStream, you might want to develop your own agent.&#x20;

Developing your own agent for LangStream is quite simple, using Python best practices. If you already have a Python application, it could be a good candidate as an Agent.

The Agent Developer Guide is broken into three milestones:

1\. [Agent Types](agent-types.md) - Understand the three main Python agents you'll use in your applications.\
2\. [Deploying Agents](broken-reference) - Create agents to process records. Handle exceptions for each agent type.\
3\. [Configuration and Testing](broken-reference) - Configure, test, and package your agents for production.

Get started with [Part 1: Agent Types.](agent-types.md)
