# LangStream Documentation

The LangStream project combines the intelligence of large language models with the agility of streaming processing, to create powerful processing applications.

An application in LangStream can watch a message topic and process data through multiple steps to output some useful generative AI results. Say you have a goal of creating a chatbot that can stay up-to-date with some dataset that is constantly changing. As someone interacts with the bot, they are offered educated meaningful answers that help them navigate some workflow.

### Features

* Run in any Kubernetes cluster using our helm chart
* Connect to popular event streaming platforms like Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar\*
* Leverage LLMs like OpenAI ChatGPT, inference APIs like HuggingFace, and chaining agents like LangChain with our included agents, no code required
* Create your own real-time AI application pipelines with simple, declarative YAML files
