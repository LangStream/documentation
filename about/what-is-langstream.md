# What is LangStream?

**LangStream** is a powerful framework for building and running Generative AI (Gen AI) applications. If you're a developer keen on leveraging the prowess of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or vector databases like Astra DB or Pinecone, all while maintaining the flexibility of stream processing, LangStream is your go-to solution. 

## Why Choose LangStream?

### Easy Development to Production
Develop and test robust Gen AI apps right on your laptop. When you're ready, deploy to a production environment powered by Kubernetes and Kafka—all through a single CLI command.

### Event-Driven Architecture
LangStream is engineered event-driven computing by a team with decades of experience. Build reactive, scalable, and fault-tolerant Gen AI applications with ease.

### Configurable Agents
Out of the box, LangStream offers configuration-driven agents designed for various tasks—be it AI chat completions, text processing, or working with vector databases. If they don't meet your unique needs, craft your own agents in Python.

### Up-to-Date Libraries
The LangStream runtime is always stocked with the latest Gen AI libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex, so you're never left behind.

### Open Source
LangStream is an open source project under the Apache 2 licence, so you are free to use it in your projects. We also welcome contributions from the community.
